Compiler/parser for simple language. For kicks.






#### Current Features ####

- Handwritten parser
- Generates LLVM bitcode.
- User-defined structs
- Arrays
- That's it ):



#### Language Syntax ####

- Actually mostly Swift-like
- 'func' to declare/define functions
- Two-pass parser, no need for forward declarations
- var id: type style variable declarations
- 'ffi' (foreign function interface) for calling into C-code
- Strictly defined types, (U?)Int(8|16|32|64) and Float(32|64)
- Arrays declared with Type[length] syntax
- Dynamic arrays not yet supported.





#### Future Plans ####

- Rule the world
- Type inference
