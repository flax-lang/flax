	/*
		implementation notes

		1. ftree needs an overhaul of some description, i think
			in the interim, ftree needs a 'parent' field, probably.
			scoping is unreliable and goes to hell

		2. dot operator is crazy rn
			instead of having a semantic pass, just let the compiler try all the static namespaces (class/struct/enum/whatever), then
			instead of failing when it can't find anything, just go and look through instance variables

			not optimal, but it's easier to optimise a working thing rather than rewrite a broken thing into a fast working thing
			anyway. might swap the order of instance/static -- there might be many classes or whatever at global scope for example,
			maybe checking local variables first, then failing, might be more prudent.

		3. a lot of places in the codegen need to account for the possibility of 'trying' -- like the scope resolution above, we need to
			be able to 'fail' safely when the static scope can't be found, so we can continue elsewhere

			eg. 'tryResolveVariableReference'

			everything is quite messy in this regard -- everything handles its own errors.

		4. speaking of which, might want to revamp how error handling works.
			while something like error("lol") might seem decent, as above, we might need a way to fail. maybe an error list that's pushed
			to? eg. `pushError("lol")`... someone needs to check that list, which might become haphazard. bad things are coming to my mind now,
			like asynchronous checking (running a separate thread) but that's a Bad Idea (tm).

			probably just stick to a normal error() routine for now. most of them would not allow continued codegen or any form of recovery
			that we care about anyway.

			it does lead to the situation of needing to fix errors one-by-one in a edit-compile-test cycle, but if you're doing things where
			you expect 102841 errors the first time, instead of maybe 4, you're doing some shit wrongly, and you're not welcome here.

			besides, compounded errors caused by previous errors (read - missing parens/semicolons/whatever in C/C++) would just clutter
			everything -- it's more useful to stop at the first error.

	// operator overloading notes:
	// top-level operators need to stay
	// method operators need to stay
	// protocols can dictate needing operators
	//
	// protocols first check the class and any extensions to see if the operator is defined
	// that's it...
	//
	// top level operators secretly create an extension on the type to the left, and make a method instead.
	// this way, protocol resolution can just check the extensions without having to bother with looking at
	// top-level functions.
	//
	// basically, top-level operators will just be syntactic sugar for extensions defining operators.


	// structs vs classes
	// structs:
	// methods. members. no intialisers.
	// extensions cannot have initialisers or stored properties
	// can conform to protocols.
	// vtable handling is done by having global vtable per type. for structs these are immutable.
	// looked up via type id.

	// classes:
	// everything. methods, members, properties, initialisers.
	// vtable is stored *in object*.
	// can be copied and modified at runtime for shits and giggles.




	// note: when we get protocol types working
	// eg. let x = String()
	// func foo(x: SomeProtocol) { ... }
	// foo(x)
	//
	// comparing fir::Type pointers isn't going to work any more.



	// todo: look into these.

	// >>> universal function call syntax -- use dot-operator calling on everything.
	// 	1. when you try to call a.b(c, ...), the usual "find a function named b in a" takes place
	// 	2. if nothing in c matches b (or c is not a compound type), use UFCS.
	// 		-> search for a function b(a, c, ...). if it exists, call it. if not, throw error as usual.

/*
	for arbitrary rc<T>, it's basically the same
	struct rc<T>
	{
		T* ptr
	}

	exactly the same; refcount is a 64-bit number stored 8 bytes before where ptr points
	to access it, same thing, cast ptr to an i64*, then subtract 1 with ptr arith.


	note: the things above will be done at the llvm level. for strings at least, we'll retain the FIR instructions for
	accessing data, len and refcount. At the llvm level, data and len will still be struct GEPs, but refcount will do some
	pointer magic. not a big deal


	for rc<T>, it's likely that it'll be a fir::Type, like fir::StringType, with an elementType. in which case, it should be similarly
	easy to set up the actual work at the llvm level. the type of refcount is always i64, so that shouldn't be a problem for the type
	system to handle.

	at the llvm level, rc<T> just gets converted to an appropriate struct type. the types are all concrete, so we can just do the
	same trick as with the strings.

	ezpz.

	this time, i'll stop doing stupid things.

	wtf:

	llvm has extractvalue and insertvalue instructions that can get member fields from non-pointer structs

/*
	more string stuff:

	the current string type stays as it is -- unicode agnostic, doesn't care what you put inside.
	only knows about bytes, nothing else.

	a new type, ustring/utfstring/utf8string

	utf8string would store a series of utf8 bytes
	basically how the old one worked.
	indexing would take O(n), codepoint length has to be recomputed on modify, to account for combining characters
	everything else basically works the same as string?

	utf32string, or maybe just utfstring, stores a series of 4-byte codepoints
	aka utf-32.

	everything works like normal strings, except with 4x the storage requirements
	faster than utf8 on things like indexing, appending
	basically space/speed tradeoff here

	still, normal string is best string
	these unicode things will be quite far into the future i think.
